- Removed glibc-2.2.2.patch - it's outdated - feature it provides is obsoleted
  by other solution
- Added fix-mouse.cpp.patch - cursor layout settings are always kept now,
  besides kcontrol no longer babling about session restart two times in case
  You change two options (white cursor & large cursor) at one time.
- Release 7
