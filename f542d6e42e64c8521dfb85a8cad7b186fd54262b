- Updated to 3.1
- Removed FONTDIR redefinition from install process - that was the wrong way!
  Files cursor*.pcf.gz should be stored in %{_datadir}/apps/kcminput
  directory for changing cursor layout ability by kcontrol. Storing them
  in /usr/share/fonts/misc causes problems and have no sense at al.
- Added fontdir.patch for storing console* fonts in /usr/share/fonts/misc
- Moved ScreenSavers directory to %{_applnkdir}/.hidden. KDE ScreenSavers
  dir was already hidden - kss files are useful when You choose them in
  kcontrol only, so there's no need to accesing them by menu.
- Updated console_all.patch - corrected "Linux" font definition.
- Added kdmconfig.patch - now kdm uses /etc/X11/kdm location only, so we
  don't need kdmrc link any longer.
- Finally removed kdmrc.patch - kdmrc file generation is corrected by
  kdmconfig.patch.
- Removed hardcoded_paths.patch - patched entries are already
  commented out.
- Removed dont_merge_old_kdmrc.patch - it's obsoleted by kdmconfig.patch
- Renumerated patches
- Fixed smb-network.desktop copying
- Putting packages in alphabetical order
- findwm is back.
